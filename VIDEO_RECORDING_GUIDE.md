## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Recording Process**

### **STEP 1: Preparation (5 minutes)**
1. **Close unnecessary applications** (clean desktop)
2. **Open your terminal** in full screen
3. **Test the demo script** once to ensure it works
4. **Prepare your script** (what you'll say)

### **STEP 2: Introduction (30 seconds)**
**Script**: *"Hi, I'm Manish, and today I'm going to demonstrate my Credit Card Fraud Detection Machine Learning project. This is an end-to-end system that achieved 91.16% F1-Score on real-world data with 1.3 million transactions."*

### **STEP 3: Run the Demo (2-3 minutes)**
1. **Start recording** your screen
2. **Run the command**: `python video_demo_enhanced.py`
3. **Let it run completely** - don't interrupt
4. **The script will automatically** show all impressive results

### **STEP 4: Show Visualizations (1 minute)**
1. **Open your visualizations folder**
2. **Display each chart**:
   - ROC Curves
   - Confusion Matrices
   - Performance Comparison
3. **Explain what each shows**

### **STEP 5: Conclusion (30 seconds)**
**Script**: *"This project demonstrates my expertise in machine learning, data science, and production-ready development. You can find the complete code and documentation on my GitHub. I'm ready for ML Engineer roles and excited to bring these skills to your team."*
