# 🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection - ML Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive machine learning solution for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Using advanced ML algorithms and techniques, we aim to minimize financial losses by accurately identifying suspicious transactions while maintaining high precision to avoid false positives.

## 🎯 Why This Matters
Credit card fraud costs the global economy **billions of dollars annually**. Financial institutions need robust systems that can:
- **Detect fraud in real-time** to prevent unauthorized transactions
- **Minimize false negatives** (missed fraud) while maintaining low false positives
- **Adapt to evolving fraud patterns** using machine learning
